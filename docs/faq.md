## How do I change a column name in the database?

By default column names are generated from property names.
You can simply change it by specifying a `name` column option:

```typescript
@Column({ name: "is_active" })
isActive: boolean;
```

## How can I set value of default some function, for example `NOW()`?

`default` column option supports a function. 
If you are passing a function which returns string,
it will use that string as a default value without escaping it.
For example: 

```typescript
@Column({ default: () => "NOW()" })
date: Date;
```

## How to do validation?

Validation is not part of TypeORM because validation is a separate process
don't really related to what ORM does.
If you want to use validation use [class-validator](https://github.com/pleerock/class-validator) library - it works perfectly with TypeORM.
## What does "owner side" in relations mean or why we need to put `@JoinColumn` and `@JoinTable` decorators?

Let's start with `one-to-one` relation.
Let's say we have two entities: `User` and `Photo`:

```typescript
@Entity()
export class User {
    
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number;
    
    @Column()
    name: string;
    
    @OneToOne()
    photo: Photo;
    
}
```

```typescript
@Entity()
export class Photo {
    
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number;
    
    @Column()
    url: string;
    
    @OneToOne()
    user: User;
    
}
```

This example does not have `@JoinColumn` decorator which is not correct.
Why? Because to make a real relation we need to create a column in the database.
We need to create a column `userId` in `photo` table or `photoId` in `user` table.
But which exactly column should be created - `userId` or `photoId`?
ORM cannot decide it for you. 
To make a decision you must `@JoinColumn` decorator on one of the side.
If you put `@JoinColumn` in `Photo` entity then `userId` column will be created in `photo` table.
If you put `@JoinColumn` in `User` entity then `photoId` column will be created in `user` table.
Where you put `@JoinColumn` decorator that side will be called "owner side of the relationship".
Other side of relation, without `@JoinColumn` decorator is called "inverse (non-owner) side of relationship".

Same in `@ManyToMany` relation you use `@JoinTable` decorator to show owner side of relation.

In `@ManyToOne` or `@OneToMany` relations `@JoinColumn` decorator is not necessary because 
both decorators are different and where you put `@ManyToOne` decorator that table will have relational column. 

`@JoinColumn` and `@JoinTable` decorators are also can be used to specify additional
join column / junction table settings, like join column name or junction table name. 

## How do I add extra columns into many-to-many (junction) table?

Its not possible to add extra columns into table created by many-to-many relation.
You'll need to create a separate entity and bind it using two many-to-one relations with target entities
(effect will be same as creating a many-to-many table), 
and add extra columns in there.

## How to use TypeORM with dependency injection tool?

In TypeORM you can use service container. Service container allows to inject custom services in some places, like in subscribers or custom naming strategies. Or for example, you can get access to ConnectionManager from any place using service container.

Here is example how you can setup typedi service container with TypeORM. But note, that you can setup any service container with TypeORM.

```typescript
import {useContainer, createConnection} from "typeorm";
import {Container} from "typedi";

// its important to setup container before you start to work with TypeORM
useContainer(Container);
createConnection({/* ... */});
```

## How to handle outDir TypeScript compiler option?

When you are using `outDir` compiler option don't forget to copy into output directory assets and resources your app is using.
Or make sure to setup correct paths to those assets.

One thing important to know is when you remove or move entities old entities left unremoved inside ouput directory.
For example you create `Post` entity and renamed it to `Blog`.
You don't have `Post.ts` file in your project, however `Post.js` file is left inside output directory.
Now when TypeORM reads entities from your output directory it sees two entities - both `Post` and `Blog`.
This may be  a source of bugs. 
That's why when you remove and move entities with `outDir` enabled its strongly recommended to remove your output directory and recompile the project again. 

## How to use TypeORM with ts-node?

You can prevent compiling files each time using [ts-node](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node).
If you are using ts-node you can specify `ts` entities inside your connection options:

```
{
    entities: ["src/entity/*.ts"],
    subscribers: ["src/subscriber/*.ts"]
}
```

Also, if you are compiling js files into same folder where your typescript files are, 
make sure to use `outDir` of the typescript compiler to prevent 
[issues](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node/issues/432). 

Also if you want to use CLI via ts-node you can execute typeorm following way:

```
ts-node ./node_modules/bin/typeorm schema:sync
```
