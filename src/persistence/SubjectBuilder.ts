/**
 * To be able to execute persistence operations we need to load all entities from the database we need.
 * Loading should be efficient - we need to load entities in as few queries as possible + load as less data as we can.
 * This is how we determine which entities needs to be loaded from db:
 *
 * 1. example with cascade updates and inserts:
 *
 * [Y] - means "yes, we load"
 * [N] - means "no, we don't load"
 * in {} braces we specify what cascade options are set between relations
 *
 * if Post is new, author is not set in the post
 *
 * [Y] Post -> {all} // yes because of "update" and "insert" cascades, no because of "remove"
 *   [Y] Author -> {all} // no because author is not set
 *     [Y] Photo -> {all} // no because author and its photo are not set
 *       [Y] Tag -> {all} // no because author and its photo and its tag are not set
 *
 * if Post is new, author is new (or anything else is new)
 * if Post is updated
 * if Post and/or Author are updated
 *
 * [Y] Post -> {all} // yes because of "update" and "insert" cascades, no because of "remove"
 *   [Y] Author -> {all} // yes because of "update" and "insert" cascades, no because of "remove"
 *     [Y] Photo -> {all} // yes because of "update" and "insert" cascades, no because of "remove"
 *       [Y] Tag -> {all} // yes because of "update" and "insert" cascades, no because of "remove"
 *
 * Here we load post, author, photo, tag to check if they are new or not to persist insert or update operation.
 * We load post, author, photo, tag only if they exist in the relation.
 * From these examples we can see that we always load entity relations when it has "update" or "insert" cascades.
 *
 * 2. example with cascade removes
 *
 * if entity is new its remove operations by cascades should not be executed
 * if entity is updated then values that are null or missing in array (not undefined!, undefined means skip - don't do anything) are treated as removed
 * if entity is removed then all its downside relations which has cascade remove should be removed
 *
 * Once we find removed entity - we load it, and every downside entity which has "remove" cascade set.
 *
 * At the end we have all entities we need to operate with.
 * Next step is to store all loaded entities to manipulate them efficiently.
 *
 * Rules of updating by cascades.
 * Insert operation can lead to:
 *  - insert operations
 *  - update operations
 * Update operation can lead to:
 *  - insert operations
 *  - update operations
 *  - remove operations
 * Remove operation can lead to:
 *  - remove operation
