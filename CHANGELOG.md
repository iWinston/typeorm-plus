# Changelog

TypeORM follows a semantic versioning and until `1.0.0` breaking changes may appear in `0.x.x` versions,
however since API is already quite stable we don't expect too much breaking changes.
If we missed a note on some change or you have a questions on migrating from old version, 
feel free to ask us and community.

## 0.2.0 (next: `npm i typeorm@next`)

* completely refactored, improved and optimized persistence process and performance.
* removed cascade remove functionality, refactored how cascades are working.
* removed `cascadeRemove` option from relation options.
* replaced `cascadeAll` with `cascade: true` syntax from relation options.
* replaced `cascadeInsert` with `cascade: ["insert"]` syntax from relation options.
* replaced `cascadeUpdate` with `cascade: ["update"]` syntax from relation options.
* now when one-to-one or many-to-one relation is loaded and its not set (set to null) ORM returns you entity with relation set to `null` instead of `undefined property` as before.
* now relation id can be set directly to relation, e.g. `Post { @ManyToOne(type => Tag) tag: Tag|number }` with `post.tag = 1` usage.
* now you can disable persistence on any relation by setting `@OneToMany(type => Post, post => tag, { persistence: false })`. This can dramatically improve entity save performance.
* `loadAllRelationIds` method of `QueryBuilder` now accepts list of relation paths that needs to be loaded, also `disableMixedMap` option is now by default set to false, but you can enable it via new method parameter `options`
* now `returning` and `output` statements of `InsertQueryBuilder` support array of columns as argument
* now when many-to-many and one-to-many relation set to `null` all items from that relation are removed, just like it would be set to empty array
* fixed issues with relation update from one-to-one non-owner side
* now version column is updated on the database level, not by ORM anymore
* now created date and update date columns is set on the database level, not by ORM anymore (e.g. using `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` as a default value)
* now `InsertQueryBuilder`, `UpdateQueryBuilder` and `DeleteQueryBuilder` automatically update entities after execution.
This only happens if real entity objects are passed.
Some databases (like mysql and sqlite) requires a separate query to perform this operation.
If you want to disable this behavior use `queryBuilder.updateEntity(false)` method.
This feature is convenient for users who have uuid, create/update date, version columns or columns with DEFAULT value set.
* now `InsertQueryBuilder`, `UpdateQueryBuilder` and `DeleteQueryBuilder` call subscribers and listeners.
You can disable this behavior by setting `queryBuilder.callListeners(false)` method.
* `Repository` and `EntityManager` method `.findOneById` is deprecated and will be removed in next 0.3.0 version.
Use `findOne(id)` method instead now.
* `InsertQueryBuilder` now returns `InsertResult` which contains extended information and metadata about runned query
* `UpdateQueryBuilder` now returns `UpdateResult` which contains extended information and metadata about runned query
* `DeleteQueryBuilder` now returns `DeleteResult` which contains extended information and metadata about runned query
* now insert / update / delete queries built with QueryBuilder can be wrapped into a transaction using `useTransaction(true)` method of the QueryBuilder.
* `insert`, `update` and `delete` methods of `QueryRunner` now use `InsertQueryRunner`, `UpdateQueryRunner` and `DeleteQueryRunner` inside
* removed deprecated `removeById`, `removeByIds` methods
* removed `deleteById` method - use `delete(id)` method instead now
* removed `updateById` method - use `update(id)` method instead now
* changed `snakeCase` utility - check table names after upgrading
* added ability to disable transaction in `save` and `remove` operations
* added ability to disable listeners and subscribers in `save` and `remove` operations
* added ability to save and remove objects in chunks
* added ability to disable entity reloading after insertion and updation
* class table inheritance functionality has been completely dropped
* single table inheritance functionality has been fixed
* `@SingleEntityChild` has been renamed to `@ChildEntity`
* `@DiscriminatorValue` has been removed, instead parameter in `@ChildEntity` must be used, e.g. `@ChildEntity("value")`
* `@DiscriminatorColumn` decorator has been removed, use `@TableInheritance` options instead now
* `skipSync` in entity options has been renamed to `synchronize`. Now if it set to false schema synchronization for the entity will be disabled.
By default its true.
* now array initializations for relations are forbidden and ORM throws an error if there are entities with initialized relation arrays.
* `@ClosureEntity` decorator has been removed. Instead `@Entity` + `@Tree("closure-table")` must be used
* added support for nested set and materialized path tree hierarchy patterns
* breaking change on how array parameters work in queries - now instead of (:param) new syntax must be used (:...param).
This fixed various issues on how real arrays must work
* changed the way how entity schemas are created (now more type-safe), now interface EntitySchema is a class
* added `@Unique` decorator. Accepts custom unique constraint name and columns to be unique. Used only on as 
composite unique constraint, on table level. E.g. `@Unique("uq_id_name", ["id", "name"])`
* added `@Check` decorator. Accepts custom check constraint name and expression. Used only on as 
composite check constraint, on table level. E.g. `@Check("chk_name", "name <> 'asd'")`
* fixed `Oracle` issues, now it will be fully maintained as other drivers 
* implemented migrations functionality in all drivers
* CLI commands changed from `migrations:create`, `migrations:generate`, `migrations:revert` and `migrations:run` to `migration:create`, `migration:generate`, `migration:revert` and `migration:run`

#### BREAKING CHANGES

* `Table`, `AbstractTable`, `ClassTableChild`, `ClosureTable`, `EmbeddableTable`, `SingleTableChild` deprecated  decorators were removed. Use `Entity`, `ClassEntityChild`, `ClosureEntity`, `SingleEntityChild` decorators instead.
* `EntityManager#create`, `Repository#create`, `EntityManager#preload`, `Repository#preload`, `EntityManager#merge`, `Repository#merge` methods now accept `DeepPartial<Entity>` instead of `Object`.
*  `EntityManager#merge`, `Repository#merge` methods first argument is now an entity where to need to merge all given entity-like objects.
* changed `find*` repository methods. Now conditions are `Partial<Entity>` type.
* removed `FindOptions` interface and introduced two new interfaces: `FindOneOptions` and `FindManyOptions` - each for its own `findOne*` or `find*` methods.
* dropped out some of options of `FindOptions`. Use `QueryBuilder` instead. However, added  few new options as well.
* deprecated method `addParameters` has been removed from `QueryBuilder`. Use `setParameters` instead.
* removed `setMaxResults`, `setFirstResult` methods in `QueryBuilder`. Use `take` and `skip` methods instead.
* renamed `entityManager` to `manager` in `Connection`, `AbstractRepository` and event objects. `entityManager` property was removed.
* renamed `persist` to `save` in `EntityManager` and `Repository` objects. `persist` method was removed.
* `SpecificRepository` is removed. Use relational query builder functionality instead.
* `transaction` method has been removed from `Repository`. Use `EntityManager#transaction` method instead.
* custom repositories do not support container anymore.
* controller / subscriber / migrations from options tsconfig now appended with a project root directory
* removed naming strategy decorator, naming strategy by name functionality. Now naming strategy should be registered by passing naming strategy instance directly.
* `driver` section in connection options now deprecated. All settings should go directly to connection options root.
* removed `fromTable` from the `QueryBuilder`. Now use regular `from` to select from tables.
* removed `usePool` option from the connection options. Pooling now is always enabled.
* connection options interface has changed and now each platform has its own set of connection options.
* `storage` in sqlite options has been renamed to `database`.
* env variable names for connection were changed (`TYPEORM_DRIVER_TYPE` has been renamed to `TYPEORM_CONNECTION`, some other renaming). More env variable names you can find in `ConnectionOptionsEnvReader` class.
* some api changes in `ConnectionManager` and `createConnection` / `createConnections` methods of typeorm main entrypoint.
* `simple_array` column type now is called `simple-array`
* some column types were removed. Now orm uses column types of underlying database.
* now `number` type in column definitions (like `@Column() likes: number`) maps to `integer` instead of `double`. This is more programmatic design. If you need to store float-pointing values - define a type explicitly.
* `fixedLength` in column options has been removed. Now actual column types can be used, e.g. `@Column("char")` or `@Column("varchar")`.
* `timezone` option has been removed from column options. Now corresponding database types can be used instead.
* `localTimezone` has been removed from the column options.
* `skipSchemaSync` in entity options has been renamed to `skipSync`.
* `setLimit` and `setOffset` in `QueryBuilder` were renamed into `limit` and `offset`.
* `nativeInterface` has been removed from a driver interface and implementations.
* now typeorm works with the latest version of mssql (version 4).
* fixed how orm creates default values for SqlServer - now it creates constraints for it as well.
* migrations interface has changed - now `up` and `down` accept only `QueryRunner`. To use `Connection` and `EntityManager` use properties of `QueryRunner`, e.g. `queryRunner.connection` and `queryRunner.manager`.
* now `update` method in `QueryBuilder` accepts `Partial<Entity>` and property names used in update map are column property names and they are automatically mapped to column names.
* `SpecificRepository` has been removed. Instead new `RelationQueryBuilder` was introduced.
* `getEntitiesAndRawResults` of `QueryBuilder` has been renamed to `getRawAndEntities`.
* in mssql all constraints are now generated using table name in their names - this is fixes issues with duplicate constraint names. 
* now when object is loaded from the database all its columns with null values will be set into entity properties as null.  Also after saving entity with unset properties that will be stored as nulls - their (properties) values will be set to null.
* create and update dates in entities now use date with fractional seconds.
* `@PrimaryGeneratedColumn` decorator now accept generation strategy as first argument (default is `increment`), instead of column type. Column type must be passed in options object, e.g. `@PrimaryGeneratedColumn({ type: "bigint"})`.
* `@PrimaryColumn` now does not accept `generated` parameter in options. Use `@Generated` or `@PrimaryGeneratedColumn` decorators instead.
* Logger interface has changed. Custom logger supply mechanism has changed.
* Now `logging` options in connection options is simple "true", or "all", or list of logging modes can be supplied. 
* removed `driver` section in connection options. Define options right in the connection options section.
* `Embedded` decorator is deprecated now. use `@Column(type => SomeEmbedded)` instead.
* `schemaName` in connection options is removed. Use `schema` instead.
* `TYPEORM_AUTO_SCHEMA_SYNC` env variable is now called `TYPEORM_SYNCHRONIZE`.
* `schemaSync` method in `Connection` has been renamed to `synchronize`.
* `getEntityManager` has been deprecated. Use `getManager` instead.
* `@TransactionEntityManager` is now called `@TransactionManager` now.
* `EmbeddableEntity`, `Embedded`, `AbstractEntity` decorators has been removed. There is no need to use `EmbeddableEntity` and `AbstractEntity` decorators at all - entity will work as expected without them. Instead of `@Embedded(type => X)` decorator now `@Column(type => X)` must be used instead. 
* `tablesPrefix`, `autoSchemaSync`, `autoMigrationsRun`, `dropSchemaOnConnection` options were removed. Use `entityPrefix`, `synchronize`, `migrationsRun`, `dropSchema` options instead.
* removed `persist` method from the `Repository` and `EntityManager`. Use `save` method instead.
* removed `getEntityManager` from `typeorm` namespace. Use `getManager` method instead.
* refactored how query runner works, removed query runner provider
* renamed `TableSchema` into `Table`
* renamed `ColumnSchema` into `TableColumn`
* renamed `ForeignKeySchema` into `TableForeignKey`
* renamed `IndexSchema` into `TableIndex`
* renamed `PrimaryKeySchema` into `TablePrimaryKey`

* `getSqlWithParameters` was renamed to `getSqlAndParameters` in `QueryBuilder`.
* sql queries are highlighted in console.
* added `@Generated` decorator. It can accept `strategy` option with values `increment` and `uuid`. Default is `increment`. It always generates value for column, except when column defined as `nullable` and user sets `null` value in to column.
* added logging of log-running requests.
* added replication support.
* added custom table schema and database support in `Postgres`, `Mysql` and `Sql Server` drivers. 
* multiple bug fixes.
* added ActiveRecord support (by extending BaseEntity) class
* `Connection` how has `createQueryRunner` that can be used to control database connection and its transaction state
