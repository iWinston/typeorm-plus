# 0.1.0 (future)

### BREAKING CHANGES

* `Table`, `AbstractTable`, `ClassTableChild`, `ClosureTable`, `EmbeddableTable`, `SingleTableChild` deprecated decorators has been removed.
Use `Entity`, `AbstractEntity`, `ClassEntityChild`, `ClosureEntity`, `EmbeddableEntity`, `SingleEntityChild` decorators instead.
* `EntityManager#create` and `Repository#create`, `EntityManager#preload` and `Repository#preload` methods now accept 
`DeepPartial<Entity>` instead of `Object`
* `EntityManager#merge` and `Repository#merge` methods now accepts `DeepPartial<Entity>` instead of `Object`,
also their first argument is an entity where to need to merge all given entity-like objects.
* changed `find*` repository methods. Now conditions are `Partial<Entity>` which makes them type-safe. 
However now `FindOptions` cannot be used with `findOne`, `findAndCount`, `find` and other methods. 
Use `fineOneByOptions`, `findAndCountByOptions`, `findByOptions` methods instead
* removed `FindOptions` interface and introduced two new interfaces: `FindOneOptions` and `FindManyOptions` - 
each for its own `findOne*` or `find*` methods
* dropped out some of options of `FindOptions`. Use `QueryBuilder` instead.
* deprecated method `addParameters` has been removed from `QueryBuilder`. Use `setParameters` instead.
* table decorators were not removed in the release, however they will be removed in next. Be sure to replace them before that.
* `QueryBuilder#setFirstResult` has been renamed to `QueryBuilder#skip`
* `QueryBuilder#setMaxResults` has been renamed to `QueryBuilder#take`
* renamed `entityManager` to `manager` in `Connection`, `AbstractRepository` and event objects
* renamed `persist` to `save` in `EntityManager` and `Repository` objects
* `@AbstractEntity` is deprecated. Now there is no need to mark class with a decorator, it can extend any class with columns
* `SpecificRepository` is deprecated for now
* `transaction` method has been removed from `Repository`. Use `EntityManager#transaction` method instead
* custom repositories do not support container anymore
* added ActiveRecord support (by extending EntityModel) class
* controller / subscriber / migrations from options tsconfig now appended with a project root directory
* removed naming strategy decorator, naming strategy by name functionality. 
Now naming strategy should be registered by passing naming strategy instance directly
* `driver` section in connection options now deprecated. All settings should go directly to connection options root.
* removed `fromTable` from the `QueryBuilder`. Now use regular `from` to select from tables
* removed `usePool` option from the connection options
* connection options interface has changed and now each platform has its own set of connection options
* `storage` in sqlite options has been renamed to `database`
* env variable names for connection were changed (`TYPEORM_DRIVER_TYPE` has been renamed to `TYPEORM_CONNECTION`, some other renaming).
More env variable names you can find in `ConnectionOptionsEnvReader` class.
* some api changes in `ConnectionManager` and `createConnection` / `createConnections` methods of typeorm main entrypoint
* `usePool` option has been removed from connection options. Now connections are working only with connection pooling

### OTHER API CHANGES

* moved `query`, `transaction` and `createQueryBuilder` to the `Connection`. 
`EntityManager` now simply use them from the connection.

### NEW FEATURES

* added `mongodb` support
* entity now can be saved partially within `update` method
* added prefix support to embeddeds
* now embeddeds inside other embeddeds are supported
* now relations are supported inside embeds
* now relations for multiple primary keys are generated properly
* now ormconfig is read from `.env`, `.js`, `.json`, `.yml`, `.xml` formats

# 0.0.7

* added custom entity repositories support
* merged typeorm-browser and typeorm libraries into single package
